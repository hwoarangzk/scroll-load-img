scroll-load-img
===============

Scroll your page down and lazy load the imgs, no need to load all the img in the document when you open your page

Need jQuery as dependency lib

Add your actual img url to a 'xSrc' property of your img element in the document:

    <img xSrc="foo/bar.jpg" />
    
If there are a lot of imgs in your page and you have to scroll down to see the whole page, this plugin enables you to lazy load the imgs which are not seen in the first sight when you open your page
